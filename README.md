This application serves as a helper for any user to keep track of their spendings month by month, categorize transactions, and view important data about their spending patterns.

On the **Home** page, users can log transactions, which are made up of a name, a date, a cost, and a category. As transactions build, users will be able to see graphs and charts representing their monthly spending over time, overall breakdowns in categorized spending, and the current month spending by category.

On the **History** page, users can view a full list of all the transactions they have ever made, sorted by the month starting at most recent. At a glance, each transaction is displayed by name and cost for identification ease. To view more information, namely the category and date, users can tap any transaction and view a popup with more information. If any transaction was made in error, users can swipe left on any transaction to delete.

On the **Settings** page, users can set a monthly spending limit, which will be used on the home page to inform users about how much money they have left for the current month. They can also add specific categories tailored to their use cases, as well as view the current categories they have. If any are unused, the user can swipe left to delete a category, marking any transactions that used to be in the deleted category as "Other".

All data is kept extremely private, all on device and never leaves.
